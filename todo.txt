IMPROVEMENTS / NEW FEATURES:

1 - Configuration panel:
      How to handle XPMs
      Undo / Redo buffer
      Color palette (how many colors, and which one).

2 - resize all cursors to fit in a 16 x 16 square

3 - Quick Help display (tooltip)  + help in status bar

4 - review size of ToolPanel (again)
     a - minimal size to increase, to fit a vertical scrollbar
     b - Minimal floating size to reduce to Tools size
     c - Best floating size to recompute

5 - performs all the drawing directly on bitmap (faster)
    remove as many calls to XPMEditorPanel::UpdateBitmap and to XPMEditorPanel::UpdateImage as possible
    (in the ProcessXXXX methods)
    Call UpdateImage only before a call to GetImage(), and whenever m_Image is used (reduce the occurence of this happening, btw)

6 - remove useless double buffering

7 - XPMEditorPanel::UpdateBitmap and XPMEditorPanel::UpdateImage optimisations:
    update only the dirty area

8 - Optimisations:
      a - draw only the visible portion of the bitmap
      b - clip drawdynamictool
      c - perhap the lag on wxGTK is coming from Undo: try to deactivate it.

9 - Rotated text can be improved

10 - SetCursor can be improved: it is not always giving the good cursor.
    Set the Cursor for the DrawCanvas AND the XPMEditorPanel (child & parent respectively)

11  in XPMEditorPanel::BuildContents
    //to do : register an event handler when AUI colours are updated
	//EVT_MENU(idSettingsEnvironment, MainFrame::OnSettingsEnvironment)


--- OTHER THINGS TO DO NOT RELATED TO XPM EDITOR ------

1 - SDK Codeblocks: add a class cbEditorPanelBase
                    add these methods to the class cbPlugin
                        GetQuickHelpPanel
                        SetQuickHelpPanel

2 - wxSmith: Style field in wxCustomClass is not saved

3 - Save As: does not update the file status in the Project Manager

---- SOLVED & DONE ----------------------------------------------
