IMPROVEMENTS / NEW FEATURES:

1 - Configuration panel:
      How to handle XPMs
      Undo / Redo buffer
      Color palette (how many colors, and which one).

2 - resize all cursors to fit in a 16 x 16 square

3 - Quick Help display (tooltip)  + help in status bar

6 - review size of ToolPanel (again)
     a - minimal size to increase, to fit a vertical scrollbar
     b - Minimal floating size to reduce to Tools size
     c - Best floating size to recompute


BUGS:
1 - Resizing selection: resizing once will paste the selection
                        loss of quality when resizing to original

2 - Text tool : finish
    When click on selection, Text entry is disconnected from image

3 - SetCursor to review

4 - DragImage + Zoom >800% : no dynamic drawing on Windows.
    This happens when the bitmap is too big to fit in memory
    The solution is to :
        1 - override wxGenericDragImage::DoDrawImage
        2 - use an UNSCALED bitmap for the selection
        3 - Temporarily set the destination dc scale to dScale
        4 - draw the dragged bitmap
        5 - reset the dc scale to 1

5 - Context menu: when a mouse click close the context menu, it should not send a mouse click event (because it clears the selection)

6 - Zoom > 200% + Selection overlaps on left edge: selection is only partially drawn.


--- OTHER THINGS TO DO NOT RELATED TO XPM EDITOR ------

1 - SDK Codeblocks: add a class cbEditorPanelBase
                    add these methods to the class cbPlugin
                        GetQuickHelpPanel
                        SetQuickHelpPanel

2 - wxSmith: Style field in wxCustomClass is not saved

3 - Save As: does not update the file status in the Project Manager

---- SOLVED & DONE ----------------------------------------------


CHANGES:
1 - Copy To / Paste from file implemented (via context menu)

2 - DragImage: bug solved when selection is large (zoomed for example)
    The cursor in that case was disappearing
    In addition, the flicker has been removed
    Solved by reordering the Drawing operations, and modifications of XPMEditorPanel::ProcessDragAction
    (hiding the drag image and repainting were not necessary).

3 - Drag action: now holding the shift key will prevent the image to be deleted

4 - Bug solved in Drag Action: 1 or 2 pixels innacuracy in draging selection with the mouse

5 - Bug solved: PasteImage gives a black image when the image is truncated

6 - Bug solved: ClearSelection: when the image to paste is bigger than the destination image, nothing is done sometimes

7 - Bug solved: MIME Handling: when no extensions was available in the file name, the Plugin was trying to open the file anyway
                and gave no chance to the default MIME handler.

8 - Added default context menu entries in Project Manager

9 - Remove some flickering when creating the editor

10 - Bug solved: When dropping a file on Code::Blocks, the file is displayed correctly - however, the Zoom function does not work.
     Editing & Saving are working.
     Loading the SAME file using the Project Manager or the File/Load menu gives normal results (no bug)

11 - Pen + Brush + Eraser: SHIFT key behaviour implemented

CHANGES:
1 - bug solved Copy / Paste:
    before copy : bitmap put in clipboard has a Mask
    after paste : bitmap does not have mask
    Solved by adding a custom data format in the clipboard

2 - Change in Text Tool.
    Currently partially broken (orientation not taken into account) due to the changes.
