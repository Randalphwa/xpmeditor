      How to handle XPMs
      Undo / Redo buffer
      Color palette (how many colors, and which one).

    after paste : bitmap does not have mask

2 - Text tool is not working anymore

3 - SetCursor to review

4 - PasteImage gives a black image when the image is truncated

5 - ClearSelection: when the image to paste is bigger than the destination image, nothing is done sometimes


--- OTHER THINGS TO DO NOT RELATED TO XPM EDITOR ------

1 - SDK Codeblocks: add a class cbEditorPanelBase
                    add these methods to the class cbPlugin
                        GetQuickHelpPanel
                        SetQuickHelpPanel

2 - wxSmith: Style field in wxCustomClass is not saved

3 - Save As: does not update the file status in the Project Manager

---- SOLVED & DONE ----------------------------------------------


CHANGES:
1 - Interpolation improved
2 - Some bugs solved
      a - Selection is not drawn when it is overlapping bitmap edges + zoom
      b - Pen problem after Move Selection + Zoom
      c - Redraw background: the bottom right corner is not covered when zooming out
      d - problem when the selection is bigger than the Image
      e - Drag image: flicker on Win32 + cursor has a strange position sometimes.
3 - Reduced size (width) of the tool palette
4 - added options for Brush & Fill tools
5 - Added stubs & interface for Spray Can tool
    (need to implement 2 methods correctly:
    XPMEditorPanel::ProcessSprayCan() and XPMToolPanel::CreateSprayCanBitmap())
6 - Added stubs & interface for Gradient tool
    (need to implement only XPMEditorPanel::ProcessGradient())



TO DO UNIX:
 1 - add 2 icons (spray can + gradient) to Project
 2 - test that the DragImage is not broken
