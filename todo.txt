IMPROVEMENTS / NEW FEATURES:

1 - Configuration panel:
      How to handle XPMs
      Undo / Redo buffer
      Color palette (how many colors, and which one).

2 - resize all cursors to fit in a 16 x 16 square

3 - Quick Help display (tooltip)  + help in status bar

4 - review size of ToolPanel (again)
     a - minimal size to increase, to fit a vertical scrollbar
     b - Minimal floating size to reduce to Tools size
     c - Best floating size to recompute

5 - DragImage: apply dc.SetUserScale & dc.Clear fix from XPMEditorPanel

6 - replace m_Image pointer by a direct object instance

7 - performs all the drawing directly on bitmap (faster)
    remove as many calls to XPMEditorPanel::UpdateBitmap and to XPMEditorPanel::UpdateImage as possible
    (in the ProcessXXXX methods)
    Call UpdateImage only before a call to GetImage(), and whenever m_Image is used (reduce the occurence of this happening, btw)

8 - remove useless double buffering

9 - XPMEditorPanel::UpdateBitmap and XPMEditorPanel::UpdateImage optimisations:
    update only the dirty area

10 - Optimisations:
      a - draw only the visible portion of the bitmap
      b - clip drawdynamictool


BUGS:
1 - Resizing selection: resizing once will paste the selection
                        loss of quality when resizing to original

2 - Text tool : finish
    When click on selection, Text entry is disconnected from image

3 - SetCursor to review

4 - Context menu: when a mouse click close the context menu, it should not send a mouse click event (because it clears the selection)

5 - Zoom > 200% + Selection overlaps on left edge: selection is only partially drawn.

6 - DragImage:
      a - when a very big image is dragged, it is clipped too much
          (comes from StretchBitmap: improve the "NewRect" parameter passed to DoDrawImage)


--- OTHER THINGS TO DO NOT RELATED TO XPM EDITOR ------

1 - SDK Codeblocks: add a class cbEditorPanelBase
                    add these methods to the class cbPlugin
                        GetQuickHelpPanel
                        SetQuickHelpPanel

2 - wxSmith: Style field in wxCustomClass is not saved

3 - Save As: does not update the file status in the Project Manager

---- SOLVED & DONE ----------------------------------------------


CHANGES:
1 - DragImage corrected
2 - scrollbars behaviour improved (scrolled by 1 pixel only)
