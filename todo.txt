IMPROVEMENTS / NEW FEATURES:

1 - Configuration panel:
      How to handle XPMs
      Undo / Redo buffer
      Color palette (how many colors, and which one).

2 - resize all cursors to fit in a 16 x 16 square

3 - Quick Help display (tooltip)  + help in status bar

4 - Copy To / Paste from file

5 - Pen + Brush + Eraser: SHIFT key behaviour to improve

6 - review size of ToolPanel (again)
     a - minimal size to increase, to fit a vertical scrollbar
     b - Minimal floating size to reduce to Tools size
     c - Best floating size to recompute


BUGS:
1 - Resizing selection: resizing once will paste the selection
                        loss of quality when resizing to original

2 - Text tool : finish
    When click on selection, Text entry is disconnected from image

3 - SetCursor to review

4 - PasteImage gives a black image when the image is truncated

5 - ClearSelection: when the image to paste is bigger than the destination image, nothing is done sometimes

6 - When dropping a file on Code::Blocks, the file is displayed correctly - however, the Zoom function does not work.
    Editing & Saving are working.
    Loading the SAME file using the Project Manager or the File/Load menu gives normal results (no bug)


--- OTHER THINGS TO DO NOT RELATED TO XPM EDITOR ------

1 - SDK Codeblocks: add a class cbEditorPanelBase
                    add these methods to the class cbPlugin
                        GetQuickHelpPanel
                        SetQuickHelpPanel

2 - wxSmith: Style field in wxCustomClass is not saved

3 - Save As: does not update the file status in the Project Manager

---- SOLVED & DONE ----------------------------------------------


CHANGES:
1 - bug solved Copy / Paste:
    before copy : bitmap put in clipboard has a Mask
    after paste : bitmap does not have mask
    Solved by adding a custom data format in the clipboard

2 - Change in Text Tool.
