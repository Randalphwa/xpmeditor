--- OTHER THINGS TO DO NOT RELATED TO XPM EDITOR ------

1 - SDK Codeblocks: add a class cbEditorPanelBase
                    add these methods to the class cbPlugin
                        GetQuickHelpPanel
                        SetQuickHelpPanel

2 - wxSmith: Style field in wxCustomClass is not saved

3 - Save As: does not update the file status in the Project Manager

---- SOLVED & DONE ----------------------------------------------


CHANGES:
 1 - Shift Key extended to other tools.
     Pen, Brush & Eraser to improve in this respect
 2 - Add a ClearSelection that I missed
 3 - LINUX: corrected a nasty bug: crash when using a complex selection
     The crash did not come from ProcessLassoTool as expected, but from IsPointInSelection.
     GTK was trying to create a polygon with less than 3 points => it raised an unhandled exception
     Bug fixed by adding a test
 4 - LINUX: corrected a widespread bug when using the wxMemoryDC.
     wxMemoryDC was created blank (without Bitmap selected). Once created, a wxMemoryDC::IsOk was called.
     On Windows it returns OK when no BMP are selected, but on GTK it returns FALSE
     Hence the drawing never took place, leading to strange results
     Fixed by moving all the call to wxMemoryDC::IsOk after selecting the bitmap
