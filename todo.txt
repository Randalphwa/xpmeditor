--- OTHER THINGS TO DO NOT RELATED TO XPM EDITOR ------

1 - SDK Codeblocks: add a class cbEditorPanelBase
                    add these methods to the class cbPlugin
                        GetQuickHelpPanel
                        SetQuickHelpPanel

2 - wxSmith: Picker classes missing.
              Style field in wxCustomClass is not saved

3 - Save As: does not update the file status in the Project Manager

---- SOLVED & DONE ----------------------------------------------


CHANGES:
 1 - Remove files from SVN (*.layout, *.obj, *.depends, build log)
 2 - Remove ColourPickerPanel.cpp and ColourPickerPanel.h (unused - replaced by XPMColourPickerPanel.cpp and XPMColourPickerPanel.h)
     Remove XPMToggleBMPButton.cpp and .h from SVN
 3 - Add help support (via html display. Help remains to be written, but it is limited to writing 6 simple HTML files)
 4 - Minimum size needed for the tool panel has been reduced and fixed
 5 - Load and Save file: use dynamic handler instead of static hard-coded switch statements based on file extension
     Moved all the code handling file format into XPMEditor.cpp
